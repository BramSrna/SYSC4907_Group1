COMMENT THE FUCK OUTTA THIS

To run application:

- Download 'expo' app on your phone and make sure it's on same network as your laptop
- Make sure you have latest Node version --> I used 12.4.0, so it might be better if we all use the same to ensure consistency
- npm install (ignore vulnerabilities if you get it IDK about that)
- npm start
- Follow instructions
